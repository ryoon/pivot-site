      <p>
        Pivot is a platform for building rich internet
        applications in Java. It combines the enhanced productivity and
        usability features of a modern RIA toolkit with the robustness
        of the industry-standard Java platform.

          <i>A sample Pivot application</i>
        </font>
      </p>

      <p>
        Pivot applications are written using a combination of Java and
        XML and can be run either as an applet or as a standalone
        (optionally offline) desktop application. While Pivot was designed
        to be familiar to web developers who have experience building AJAX
        applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a much
        richer set of standard widgets than HTML, and allows developers to
        create sophisticated user experiences much more quickly and easily.
        Pivot will also seem familiar to Swing developers, as both Swing and
        Pivot are based on Java2D and employ a model-view-controller (MVC)
        architecture to separate component data from presentation. However,
        Pivot includes additional features that make building modern GUI
        applications much easier, including declarative UI, data binding,
        effects and transitions, and web services integration.

    <section name="Incubation At Apache">

      <p>
        Apache Pivot is an effort undergoing incubation at The ASF, sponsored
        by the Apache Incubator Project Management Committee (PMC).
      </p>

      <p>
        Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further
        review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision
        making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other
        successful ASF projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the
        completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project
        has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
