    <section name="Incubation At Apache">

      <p>
        Apache Pivot is an effort undergoing incubation at The ASF, sponsored
        by the Apache Incubator Project Management Committee (PMC).
      </p>

      <p>
        Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further
        review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision
        making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other
        successful ASF projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the
        completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project
        has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
