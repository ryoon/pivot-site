            <p>
                The Apache Pivot Project operates on a meritocracy: the more you do,
                the more responsibility you will obtain. This page lists all of the
                people who have gone the extra mile and are Committers or members of
                the Project Management Committee. If you would like to help, please
                see the overview on <a href="get-involved.html">getting involved</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                We ask that you please do not send us emails privately asking for support. We
                are non-paid volunteers who help out with the project, and we do not
                necessarily have the time or energy to help people on an individual
                basis. Instead, we have setup <a href="lists.html">mailing
                lists</a> which contain many individuals who will help answer
                detailed requests for help. The benefit of using mailing lists over private
                communication is that it is a shared resource where others can also learn from
                common questions, and as a community, we all grow together.
            </p>
