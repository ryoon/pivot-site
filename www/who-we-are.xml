    <section name="Who We Are">
      <p>
        The Apache Pivot Project operates on a meritocracy: the more you do,
        the more responsibility you will obtain. This page lists all of the
        people who have gone the extra mile and are Committers or members of
        the Project Management Committee. If you would like to help, please
        see the overview on <a href="get-involved.html">getting
        involved</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We ask that you please do not send us emails privately asking for support. We
        are non-paid volunteers who help out with the project and we do not
        necessarily have the time or energy to help people on an individual
        basis. Instead, we have setup <a href="lists.html">mailing
        lists</a> which contain many individuals who will help answer
        detailed requests for help. The benefit of using mailing lists over private
        communication is that it is a shared resource where others can also learn from
        common mistakes, and as a community we all grow together.
      </p>

        The following is a list of the Apache Pivot PMC members and committers.
