                Apache Pivot&#0153; is an open-source platform for building installable Internet
                applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and usability features
                of a modern user interface toolkit with the robustness of the Java platform.

                <h2>Why Pivot?</h2>
                <p>
                    Pivot allows developers to easily construct visually-engaging, cross-platform,
                    connected applications in Java or any other JVM language, such as JavaScript,
                    Groovy, or Scala. Pivot is also the only truly open IIA framework: it is
                    completely open source, and is driven entirely by the software development
                    community.<br/><br/>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Pivot enables developers to build solutions using the tools they already know,
                    decreasing delivery time and reducing technology sprawl.
                </p>
            </div>

                        <p>"
                        After initially considering a number of different technologies to use
                        for a new cross-platform application, we decided to use Pivot both
                        because of its wide variety of controls and ability to be seamlessly deployed
                        as either a desktop application and a web applet.
                        But since then, we have been impressed with the overall design of the framework,
                        the ability (being an Apache open-source project) to add features,
                        fix bugs and get improvements made, and with the responsiveness of the developers
                        to answer questions and work through problems.
                        So now we are just about to do our first commercial release of this product.
