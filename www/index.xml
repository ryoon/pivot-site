        <p>
          Pivot applications are written using a combination of Java and XML and can be run
          either as an applet or as a standalone (optionally offline) desktop application.
          Pivot includes additional features that make building modern GUI applications
          much easier, including declarative UI, data binding, effects and transitions,
          and web services integration.
