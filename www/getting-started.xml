            <p>
                The <a href="tutorials/">Pivot tutorial</a> is a great place to get started. It
                covers the overall architecture of the platform, walks through a few requisite
                "Hello World" examples, and then proceeds to cover every Pivot component using real
                examples.

        <section name="Download Pivot">
            <p>
                To follow along with the examples in the Pivot tutorial, you'll need a local copy
                of the Pivot <release/> release. The binary and source distributions are available
                for <a href="download.cgi#{$release}">download</a> through one of Apache's mirrors.

            <p>
                The best place to get your questions answered is the <a href="lists.html#user">
                user mailing list</a>. Many people on the mailing lists have gone through the same
                learning curve and are ready and willing to help.

        <section name="Learn About WTKX">
            <p>
                One of the benefits of using Pivot is the optional use of the GUI markup language,
                WTKX. Its use can dramatically speed up development of visual user interfaces. To
                develop a firm understanding of the relationship between WTKX and the Java code
                that it represents, we recommend reading the <a href="tutorials/wtkx-primer.html">
                WTKX primer</a>.
