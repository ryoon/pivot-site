        <section name="What is Apache Pivot?">
            <p>
                Apache Pivot&#0153; is an open-source platform for building installable Internet
                applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and usability features
                of a modern user interface toolkit with the robustness of the Java platform.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section name="Why Pivot?">
            <p>
                Pivot allows developers to easily construct visually-engaging, cross-platform,
                connected applications in Java or any other JVM language, such as JavaScript,
                Groovy, or Scala. Pivot is also the only truly open IIA framework: it is
                completely open source, and is driven entirely by the software development
                community.<br/><br/>
            </p>

            <p>
                Pivot enables developers to build solutions using the tools they already know,
                decreasing delivery time and reducing technology sprawl.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section name="Pivot's History">
            <p>
                Pivot began as an R&amp;D effort at VMware in 2007 and was released as an
                open-source project in June 2008 under the Apache 2.0 license. Pivot joined the
                Apache Incubator in January 2009 and graduated as a top-level Apache project in
                December 2009. It is currently driven entirely by the software development
                community.
