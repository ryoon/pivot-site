The Apache Pivot Website Instructions
---------------------------------------

The Pivot web site is based on XML files which are transformed into HTML files using XSLT and Ant.

In order to build the site, Ant needs to know the location of the folder on your local file system
that represents http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/pivot/trunk/. This location is passed to the Ant
build using the 'folder.trunk' parameter. The build will not run without this parameter being
specified.

An example command to build the site, which will build the site into the deploy/ folder, is as
follows:

  $ ant -Dfolder.trunk=/path/to/pivot/trunk build

Make sure you don't run clean, as this will wipe the deploy/.svn/ folder. To deploy updated pages
to the Pivot web site, you check in the built files, then ssh over to people.apache.org, go to
/www/pivot.apache.org/, and svn update.
