The Apache Pivot Website Instructions
---------------------------------------

The Pivot web site is based on .xml files which are transformed
into .html files using XSLT and Ant.

NOTE: In order to build, the site requires symbolic links to be set up that point to the demos and
tutorials 'www' folders. If you are on a platform that supports symbollic links, these links will be
created for you when you check out the Pivot site from SVN; by default, they will be:

  demos -> ../../trunk/demos/www
  tutorials -> ../../trunk/tutorials/www

If these default links do not match your local folder structure, then you should update the links
to point to the correct folders:

  // Current folder is [site-trunk]
  $ ln -s [pivot-trunk]/demos/www demos
  $ ln -s [pivot-trunk]/tutorials/www tutorials

Once you have the site checked out locally and the symbolic links set up, cd into your site trunk
directory and execute:

> ant clean build

This will build the site into the ant-bin/ directory.

Note that the generated pages do not get checked into SVN. To deploy updated pages to the Pivot web
site, you should scp the pages to people.apache.org:/www/pivot.apache.org/.
