The Apache Pivot Website Instructions
---------------------------------------

The Pivot web site is based on .xml files which are transformed
into .html files using XSLT and Ant.

NOTE: In order to build the site, Ant needs to know the location of the folder on your local file
system that represents http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/pivot/trunk/. This location is passed to the
Ant build using the 'folder.trunk' parameter. The build will not run without this parameter being
specified.

An example command to build the site, which will build the site into the ant-bin/ folder, is as
follows:

  $ ant -Dfolder.trunk=/path/to/pivot/trunk clean build

Note that the generated pages do not get checked into SVN. To deploy updated pages to the Pivot web
site, you should scp the pages to people.apache.org:/www/pivot.apache.org/.
