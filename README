The Apache Pivot Website Instructions
---------------------------------------

***NOTE***
DO NOT EDIT THE .html files in the site-publish directory.
Please follow the directions below for updating the website.
***NOTE***

The Pivot web site is based on .xml files which are transformed
into .html files using XSLT and Ant.

In order to make modifications to the Pivot web site, you need to first check out
the Pivot site from SVN. To check out the Pivot site into a sub-directory
called pivot-site in the current directory:

svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/pivot/site/trunk pivot-site

Once you have the site checked out locally, cd into your
pivot-site directory and execute:

> ant

This will build the documentation into the site-publish/ directory. The output
will show you which files got re-generated.

If you would like to make modifications to the web site documents,
you simply need to edit the files in the site-author/ directory.

The files in site-author/stylesheets are the global files for the site. If you make a
modification to project.xml, it will affect the left side navigation for the
web site, and all of your .html files will be re-generated.

Once you have built your documentation and confirmed that your changes are
ok, you can check your .xml and your .html files back into SVN.

Then, copy the contents of the site-publish directory to
people.apache.org:/www/incubator.apache.org/pivot/ to have the changes reflected
on the Pivot web site.
