The Apache Pivot Website Instructions
---------------------------------------

The Pivot web site is based on XML files which are transformed into HTML files using XSLT and Ant.

In order to build the site, Ant needs to know the location of the folder on your local file system
that represents http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/pivot/trunk/. This location is passed to the Ant
build using the 'folder.trunk' parameter. The build will not run without this parameter being
specified.

An example command to build the site, which will build the site into the deploy/ folder, is as
follows:

  $ ant -Dfolder.trunk=/path/to/pivot/trunk build


Make sure you don't run clean, as this will wipe the deploy/.svn/ folder.
To deploy updated pages to the Pivot web site, now it'e enough to check in the built files.


Note that when regenerating the site, the version is taken from the build.properties file
in pivot trunk, so for example during a web site maintenance/update:
change it back temporary to the current version published in the web site, 
and finally revert local changes to that file.

For example:

  $ ant -Dfolder.trunk=../../trunk build
