This folder contains some files copied by hand, to be able to make some loading test from Client applications.bxml (and related) resources are here to simulate bxml files (dynamically) generated at server side.The full URL for this folder (live, from the production web site) is:http://pivot.apache.org/assets-for-testsNote on loading bxml files, but from remote (for example see JavascriptConsoleTest, under the tests subproject):secondary bxml files (included by others) could not be foundloading in the usual (relative) way, so to handle safely even those cases by convention I use a variable(accessible or defined directly in JavaScript inside bxml files) called resourcesBaseURLbut it's not possible to test if undefined (like in standard JavaScript inside browsers), so must be defined(at least as an empty string, or a good base URL terminated by /).
