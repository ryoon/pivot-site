This folder contains some files copied by hand, to be able to make some loading test from Client applications.bxml (and related) resources are here to simulate bxml files (dynamically) generated at server side.The full URL for this folder (live, from the production web site) is:http://pivot.apache.org/assets-for-testsAs a minimal sample for loading bxml files, see JavascriptConsoleTest, under the tests subproject.Note that to load from remote secondary bxml files (included by main bxml files loaded by the application),it's better to define a variable (accessible or defined directly in JavaScript inside bxml files) for example called resourcesBaseURL where to store its base folder (but in URL format).If defined in JavaScript it's not possible to test if it's undefined (like in standard JavaScript inside browsers),so it must always be defined (at least as an empty string, or a good base URL terminated by /).Or define in Java and for example then put in bxmlSerializer namespace.Important: remember that to load a remote file it's necessary to use the (more generic) version of the loader method(usually done in the application Java Main Class, or in an utility one) that takes an URL (maybe even to load a local file),and not only the filename ...Note that to let secondary bxml files see/use variables (defined in Java or in JavaScript),you have to put them in bxmlSerializer namespace, as done in the example (both cases).
